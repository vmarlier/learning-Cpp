# Dungeon Crawl

Requires:
variables, data types, and numerical operators
basic input/output
logic (if statements, switch statements)
loops (for, while, do-while)
arrays

Make a program that outputs a simple grid based gameboard to the screen using either numbers or characters.
i.e.

. . . . . . . . . .
. G . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . T . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . T . . . . .
. . . . . . T . . .
. . . . . . . . . X

Allow the user (marked by G in the example) to move either up, down, left, or right each turn. If the player steps on a trap then they lose. If the make it to the treasure 'X' then they win.

★★ Add enemies that move randomly in any direction once per turn. (enemies just like traps cause the player to lose if touched)

HINT: Don't let the player move off the gameboard! You program will crash if they move off the top or bottom of the board!
(the same holds true for enemies)
